    <h2><i><b>Introduction:</b></i></h2>
    <p>V.O. Chidambarampillai (VOC) was born on 5 September 1872 in Ottapidaram, Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu (the same district which a hundred years earlier gave birth to Veerapandiya Kattabomman).<br>
    Chidambarampillai was the eldest son of Ulaganathan Pillai and Paramayi Ammai. His early education was in Tuticorin. He passed a pleadership examination in 1894, enabling him to practise law at the local sub-magistrate's court. He then went on to practise at the nearby port town of Tuticorin.<br>
    The partition of Bengal in 1905, the rise of militancy evidenced by the Swadeshi (boycott of foreign goods) movement, saw Chidambarampillai taking a direct interest in the political struggle. These were the years before the arrival of Gandhi on the Indian political landscape.</p>

    <h2><i><b>Political Life:</b></i></h2>
    <h3><b>Background:</b></h3>
    <p>In the 1890s and 1900s, India's independence movement and the Swadeshi movement, initiated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai of the Indian National Congress (INC), were at their peak. From 1892, Chidambaram Pillai was influenced by Tilak Maharaj and became his disciple. Along with Subramanya Siva and Subramanya Bharathi, he became a prominent spokesperson for the cause in the Madras Presidency. Following the partition of Bengal in 1905, Chidambaram entered politics, joining the Indian National Congress and taking a hardliner stance. He also presided at the Salem District Congress session.</p>

    <h3><b>Companies and Institutions:</b></h3>
    <p>Chidambaram Pillai established many institutions like Yuvanesh Prachar Sabha, Dharmasanga Nesavu Salai, National Godown, Madras Agro-Industrial Society Ltd., and Desabimana Sangam. In response to the British India Steam Navigation Company's trade monopoly, Chidambaram started an Indian-owned shipping company. He registered the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company in October 1906. The capital of the company was ten lakh rupees. The number of shares was 40,000 and the face value of each share was Rs. 25. Any Asian could become a shareholder. The director of the company was Pandi Thurai Thevar, Zamindar of Palavanatham and the founder of "Madurai Tamil Sangam".</p>
